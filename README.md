This API was made in javascript and uses Express.js and mongoose frameworks, please install them before use. The database is hosted by MongoDB Atlas.

### Data sctructure

This data structure, based on mongoose schemas, returns all data required from the database via Express Endpoints, and saves the data in one dictionary per user.

###### Structure format

The structure format is:
>```lang-json
>{
>   __id: ObjectId() //A unique identificator autogenerated
>   name: "user",
>   email: "user@example.com",
>   password: "password",
> 
>   financeInfo: {
>       totalEarnings: 100,
>       totalExpenses: 50,
>       balance: 50, //The balance is the diference between earnings and expenses
>       savings: 20 
>       savingPercent: 0.2 //The multiplier of the total saving
>
>       //Earnings and expenses are a transactions array
>       earnings: [Transactions],
>       expenses: [Transactions],
>
>       //Then, the history is an array of other dictionary
>       history:[montlyFinanceInfo]
>   }
>   creditCards:[creditCard]
>   //The creditCard dictionaries contains the classic credit card credentials
>}
>```

The transactions structure defines by
>```lang-json
>{
>   name: "Transaction Name",
>   type: "Trasaction Category",
>   date: "01/01/2031", //Important: Into mongoose, this is a date object
>   amount: 30 //The transaction value
>   decription: "A short description of the transaction (Optional)"
> }

the montlyFinanceInfo structure defines by
>```lang-json
>{
>   month: 0 //Number between 0 and 11, 0 = january, 2 = february, 11 = december...
>   year: 2031,
>   montlyEarnings: 100,
>   montlyExpenses: 50
>   balance: 50,
>   savings: 20,
>   savingTarget: 15 //This is a goal to save
> }


The credit card structure defines by
>```lang-json
>{
>   cardNumber: "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
>   name: "User Holder",
